	This is the official release of version 4.0 of MicroEMACS. This
file gives information on registering MicroEMACS, features which have
changed since version 3.12, notes on various installations, future
directions for MicroEMACS, contact information and bug reporting
procedures.

********** Registering MicroEMACS **********

	Keeping many environments up to date, fielding questions over
the phone, applying bug fixes and adding new features is reasonably
large task. I have been writing, maintaining and supporting MicroEMACS
since 1985. I have bought numerous computers solely to port and support
MicroEMACS on those platforms. I can not even begin to count the number
of people using MicroEMACS, and I have recieved support calls,
registrations and inquiries from many countries all over the globe. This
keeps me very busy for a hobby that I do outside my normal employment.
	If you like MicroEMACS, and want to see more work, new versions
and other shareware software to go along with it, show your support by
registering your copy. Send your registration of $25 US and I will place
you on the registration list. You will recieve information on new
releases and preferential support. If you have recieved MicroEMACS
through a software library, a CDROM collection, or a user's group, none
of those fees are passed along to the software author. Register with me
and get the latest versions, info and have a voice into future
directions.

********** Installation Notes **************

	MicroEMACS is supplied for MSDOS/OS2/WINDOWS 95/WINDOWS NT on
two 3 1/2" inch diskettes in IBMPC format. The first disk is an MSDOS,
MicroSoft Windows 95/Windows NT and OS/2 installation disk. For any of
these environments, insert the disk into your A: drive, and type:

	a:install

	The installation program will lead you through installing
MicroEMACS and all of its related files on your system's hard drive.
After installation, these are the names of the various executables:

	EMACS.EXE	MSDOS real mode version (640K limit)
	EMACS16M.EXE	MSDOS protected mode version
			(will use all memory, slightly slower than real mode)
	MEWIN.EXE	MicroSoft Windows 3.1 version
	OS2EMACS.EXE	OS/2 1.3, 2.0 or 2.1 version
	NTEMACS.EXE	Windows NT console mode version

	The second disk is a ZIP archive of all the sources, documents,
command files and makefiles. Copy this file to an empty directory on
your hard drive, and then use any unZIPper and allow it to extract this
tree of files on your hard drive. Some of the resulting files and
subdirectories will include:

AIX          makefiles for AIX (a UNIX varient)
AMIGA        makefiles for the Commodore AMIGA
ATARI        makefiles for the Atari ST
CMD          standard .CMD command files
DGEN         makefiles for the Data General
DOC          documentation files (including this!)
FREEBSD      makefiles for FREEBSD 2.0 and above
FMR          makefiles for the Fujitsu FMR series MSDOS computers
H            .H header files
HP150        makefile for the HP150 MSDOS computer
HPUX         makefile for the HP9000 workstations
I55          makefile for the IBM 5550 Katakana computer
MPE          makefile for the HP3000 series computer
MSWIN        makefiles and auxillary files for MicroSoft Windows 95
NEC          makefiles for the NEC 9800 series MSDOS machines
NT           makefiles for Windows NT
OS2          makefiles for OS/2
PCDOS        makefiles for various IBM-PC compilers and versions
POSIX        makefiles for POSIX (a UNIX varient)
SRC          .C source files
SUN4         makefiles for SUN-OS 4.1 and above (not Solaris)
VMS          makefile for DEC's VMS operating system
WINHELP      source code for the windows help files
XENIX        makefiles for XENIX
CLROBJ.BAT   MSDOS batch file to clear out all the object and executable files

	Included on this disk is a public domain MSDOS unzipping program
called "unzip" written by a group of USENET programmers. Both the actual
executable and the self unpacking package with all of its documention is
provided. Copy the diskette to the target directory, and type:

	unzip ue400dev

	to extract all the sources, command files, makefiles and
documentation to their proper directories within the that directory.

	If you need to build a version from the source files, unpack
these files, and move them and all its subdirectories to the target
machine. Change to the directory most appropriate for the machine for
which you are building MicroEMACS. Copy from the H subdirectory the file
ESTRUCT.H to this directory. Edit ESTRUCT.H, changing the definition
from zero to one for the appropriate hardware, compiler, terminal
driver. Edit any other parameters or options as appropriate. You may
need to create an OBJ and a BIN subdirectory from this directory. Then
run your make utility to compile and link a MicroEMACS executable.

	Under MicroSoft Windows, or Windows NT, use the NEW option of the
FILES menu of the file program manager to add a program item. Set the
program executable to the drive where you installed MicroEMACS,
remembering the name of the Windows executable is mewin.exe. The
MicroEMACS icon will appear in the program window you have currently
open.

	Under Windows 95, or the newer versions of Windows NT (Version
4.0 and above), press the START button, select SETTINGS and then select
TASKBAR. Once within this dialog, use it to add an entry in your program
menu to execute the MicroEMACS executable file. Windows 95 will handle
all the needed memory settings.

	Under OS/2, copy a program template to the desktop, and then use
its settings menu to set the path to the program executable and the
correct working directory. The name of the OS/2 executable is
OS2EMACS.EXE. The icon for MicroEMACS should replace the template icon.
Drag this to where you want it to be placed.

	Under the differing varieties of UNIX, if you are installing
MicroEMACS systemwide, you need to place it and all of its command files
into a directory that all your users can access. Rename the emacs.rc
startup file to .emacsrc. Once your users have this directory in their
path, they will be able to use MicroEMACS. They can create a local
.emacsrc file that will overide the code in the system MicroEMACS
startup file. Be carefull to allow read permissions on all the
MicroEMACS files.

	On the Atari ST, be sure that MicroEMACS is installed as a GEM
application from the GEM desktop.  If this is not done, MicroEMACS will
grow confused about the state of the mouse, and ring the bell alot to
alert the user to the problem.  (Mouse handling on the Atari is both
complex and triple layered....).

********** Edit history since the First 4.00 BETA release

 *	29 Mar 95
 *	- at John Gamble's suggestion, we have eliminated the need of the
 *	  makelit() function, making uEMACS 682 bytes smaller under MSDOS!
 *	- made the ldelete() function flag the position of saved text at
 *	  the front of the string when deleteing backwards. This fixes some
 *	  problems with undos of backward deleted text.
 *	- made the delete-previous-word (M-^H) command push a OP_CPOS
 *	  on the stack so an undo of it works properly.
 *	- rewrote the macroes in epage.cmd not to use numbered macroes.
 *	4 apr 95
 *	- increased the buffer name max size to 128.... to match the user
 *	  variables and everything else in the expresion evaluator.
 *	- a missing long cast in abbrev.c in ab_expand() cause problems
 *	  in 23 bit environments. All fixed.
 *	- replaced all calls to realloc() to reroom() to allow the old
 *	  undo info to be reclaimed on failure.
 *	- some fixes in main.c dealing with REP and OVER modes allowing
 *	  inserts of characters with repeat counts in these mores to work,
 *	  as given to me by John Gamble.
 *	- a laborious hour long process to fix the indentation of braces
 *	  in main.c. Clearly anyone who prefers their own style should
 *	  keep their hands off my code. This screws with my mind and with
 *	  our every attempt to provide diffs.
 *	6 apr 95
 *	- fixed the OVER and REP mode code to store a cursor position
 *	  undo entry to get the cursor position correct on undos.
 *	- dumped the DOS16M symbol now that the reroom() routine
 *	  replaces realloc() and it checks for a null pointer, making
 *	  sure there are no attempts to realloc() a null pointer.
 *	[April 10, 1995 - released version 4.0 BETA 2 for beta testing]
 *	6 may 95 John Gamble
 *	- Cleaned up code dealing with MAGIC (the compile option) == 0.
 *	  Affects tag.c, eval.c, search.c and replace.c.
 *	- linstr() checks for empty strings now.  This prevents adding
 *	  an uneeded UNDO object.
 *	- getctext() was using a local array as a return value.  This
 *	  is a no-no.  It now takes an array as an argument, and returns
 *	  that.
 *	- $disphigh was not being checked for most column calculator
 *	  functions.  The cursor was getting misplaced as a result.
 *	  Added checks in mouse.c and random.c.  Removed some duplicate
 *	  code in display.c as a result (updpos() now just calls getccol()).
 *	- Search now highlights the match on the screen.  Uses mark # 10,
 *	  which means it is on by default.  Change $hilight to prevent this,
 *	  or compile with a different mark number.
 *	- WIN3.0 support dropped.  Affects files mswin.h, mswemacs.c,
 *	  mswfont.c, mswdrv.c, mswinput.c.
 *	- Title and version now on the Windows title bar.  Change in mswsys.c.
 *	  No longer put title and version on modeline for Windows version.
 *	- Magenta and Lmagenta had identical values in the palette array.
 *	  Changed Lmagenta.  Also, Yellow and Lyellow were nearly
 *	  indistinguishable.  Altered both values in mswdisp.c.
 *	- changed a "select-buffer "Function Keys"" line in emacs.rc to
 *	  "1 select-buffer "Function Keys""  to ensure the buffer is
 *	  always invisible in Windows.
 *	- New mdi.cmd takes advantage of $newscreen - no more "Relay Screen"
 *	  flashing for reading files (screen rebuild still uses it though).
 *	27 may 1995 John Gamble
 *	- The function scanner() goes away - mcscanner can handle jump
 *	  tables, and uses the special MC structs mcdeltapat and tapatledcm
 *	  for that purpose.  (scanner() actually sticks around for those
 *	  who compile MicroEMACS without a magic mode, there's a #define).
 *	- Variable numsubs in replaces() is type long now.  TEXT92 in all
 *	  language files has the %d changed to %D.
 *	- MS-Windows version now reads and writes to EMACS.INI, not WIN.INI.
 *	- EMACS.INI also has a new entry CaretShape, which may be set
 *	  to values "horizontal", "vertical", or "fullcell".  This had
 *	  been a compile option in mswin.h, now it is a settable ini value.
 *	- Making a buffer INVISIBLE was also marking it as changed if you
 *	  did it by setting $cbflags.  Bug in eval.c is now fixed.
 *	- New compile const HANDLE_WINCH for telling which machines
 *	  handle the windows-changed signal.
 *	- Put in Eric Picheral's suggested changes:
 *	  o GNU has a getkey/setkey combo... change ours to [gs]et_key().
 *	  o wordcount() was checking hard-coded letter values, now it
 *	    uses is_letter().
 *	  o Added USG and the HPUXes to the NFILEN condtion in estruct.h.
 *	  o Put an unsigned char cast in lgetc() macro for some Unixes.
 *	  o variable uv_head was misspelled ut_head in main.c.
 *	  o Added WINDOW_MSWIN and AIX to list to include frenchis.h over
 *	    french.h in elang.h.
 *	  o New french.h and frenchis.h files.
 *	31 May 95 Daniel Lawrence
 *	- re-ported current version to Windows NT. Fixed makefile to work with
 *	  visual C++ 2.0. Set PAUSE key to generate FN: and bound it to
 *	  execute-command-line. Set to ignore scroll lock key.
 *	- got rid of a lot of unreferenced local variables
 *	9 June 95
 *	- modified &cat to never overwrite its buffer
 *	15 June 95
 *	- added $popwait, which when false suppresses the user input during
 *	  a pop-up buffer (for macroes!)
 *	17 June 95
 *	- bumped the maximum number of rows under windows up to 128 from 50.
 *	- get the true length of the pattern rather than using matchlen
 *	  while in MAGIC mode, as submitted by Frank Kaefer.
 *	18 June 95 John Gamble
 *	- New functions &mkcol and &mkline respectively return the column
 *	  number and line number of mark n, if n is valid and exists.
 *	  They return -1 and 0 otherwise.
 *	- Bruce Momjian's mark fix for including text wasn't completely
 *	  implemented, added the second portion that he posted.
 *	10 Sept 95 John Gamble
 *	- added add-keymap and list-keymappings to commands.  Code
 *	  that formerly was duplicated in ansi.c, mpe.c, unix.c, smg.c,
 *	  vms.c gets consolidated into keyboard.c.  Command add-keymap
 *	  exists to replace the set $palette "KEYMAP ..." strangeness,
 *	  list-keymappings displays what's been mapped in a popped buffer.
 *	18 Nov 95 Daniel Lawrence
 *	- moved the prototyping for the new keymapping functions from
 *	  eproto.h backtokeybaoard.c. The needed structures for their
 *	  declarations were not even defined for non-unix environments.
 *	- bug in file.c in the unix code caused the wrong buffer to be
 *	  marked as read-only when there was no file access. Fixed it.
 *	- in undo() it was possible to execute undo_op() even when the
 *	  endo stack was empty. This caused a zero pointer reference.
 *	  This is now fixed.
 *	29 Dec 95
 *	- added 2 calls to movecursor (in echostring() and mlprompt())
 *	  to make sure the physical cursor is updated to the logical cursor.
 *	  This had been a problem in the Windows NT driver.......
 *	- some lowercase "void" function declarations in eval.c, screen.c
 *	  and undo.c has to be made "VOID". The SUN showed is this.

********** Major New Features since 3.12 *********

>>>	Multilevel UNDO command

	The new undo (^_) command undos editing changes since the last
buffer read in each editing buffer. Various commands and environment
variables support this new highly requested feature.

>>>	Search commands enhanced

	All the various search commands now hilite the results of their
search on success.

>>>	Enhancement to the macro language

	Local and Global user variables are now supported. Also, stored
functions can now have parameters which are call by value.

>>>	Windows 95 enhancements

	Bringing up new screens in windows has been simplified, no longer
needing a "relay screen". MicroEMACS now has its own EMACS.INI file instead
of listing its options in WIN.INI.

>>>	Abbreviation Features added

	New commands, environment variables and functions added to
handle the automatic expansion of abbreviations as they are typed into a
text buffer.

>>>	Magic Mode Enhancements

	New meta characters in magic mode allow the matching to the
beginning and end of words. Added the Boyer-Moore algorithm to the MAGIC
mode searches where literal characters are in the search pattern.

>>>	Unix keymapping layer enhanced

	The layer responcible for mapping escape sequences to bindings
has been rewritten,and now the commands add-keymap and list-keymappings
are active in those environments.

>>>	FREEBSD support

	Support for FREEBSD 2.0 and greater running on a 386 PC or
higher is now complete.

>>>	XVT driver

	Support for the XVT portible windowing system is included. This
has been tested under MicroSoft windows.

>>>	Bug Fixes

	As usual.... most of the bugs pointed out in version 3.12 have
been thoroughly squashed.

********** Online Documents ****************

	The Windows help file and the TEXT online documents have been
partially updated for the 4.0 release. I found finishing the online
documents has been holding up the release for far too long, so I will
promise to have the online documents updated with the next minor
release. 

********** Future Directions ***************

	I am continuing work on MicroEMACS, and look forward to a number
of improvements in the near to farther future. Ranked in approximate
order are:

	- Macintosh Support
	- An OS/2 Presentation Manager version
	- A possible VI user interface (MicroVImacs)

********** Support *************************

	Support for MicroEMACS 4.0 is available in a couple of
different ways.  First, it is available via my unix system..... 

	AQUEST.COM
	(317) 742-5533
	24 hours  300/1200/2400/9600HST/14400 baud

	user: uemacs
	password: support

	There will be message areas devoted to MicroEMACS where I and
other people can answer your questions. Also there are file areas for
staying abreast of the current development version and finding and
trading macro files.

	MicroSPELL 2.1 is also available.  This version is the first
major update released in several years. These program allows you to
spell check text files and use MicroEMACS to scan the file, making
suggestions and doing various corrections.

	As before, I will continue to support these programs, and
encourage everyone to spread them around as much as they can. If you
make what you think are changes that are useful to many, send me the
updates, and as time permits, I will incorporate the ones I understand,
and agree with into the master sources.
