Thank you for your inquiry,

MicroEMACS is available from a number of different sources. Via FTP on
Internet, it can be obtained from walker.aquest.com (204.120.165.161) or
midas.mgmt.purdue.edu (128.210.13.1) via anonymous FTP. That version is

TAR format.

Also you can call my BBS system, The Programmer's Room, at (317)

but it will always be the latest. The latest full release is also
available from this BBS.
