 *      Adapted from code by Danial Lawrence for the IBM-PC.
 *
 *      February 1993, David G. Holm (email address: dgh@bix.com)
 *               Updated to work with new TERM structure in 3.12 BETA 1.
 *               Updated to work with Borland's C/C++ compilers.
 *
 * The routines in this file provide support for the TI-PC and other
 * compatible terminals. It truely writes directly to the screen RAM to do
 * screen output. It compiles into nothing if not a TI-PC driver.
 *
 * This driver for the TIPC is not the same one that Daniel Lawrence
 * distributes.  He uses TI's DSRs for most functions as you can see by
 * looking at the driver in ue311c.arc.  Dan's reverse video
 * also does not work.  But do not blame him as I'm sure he does not
 * have a TIPC to test Emacs on and he *is* supportting the TIPC.
 * [Well, as you can see, it is the one I distribute now! - DAN]
 * This driver uses direct writes to screen memory except for the message
 * line like the IBM driver.  In fact I keep TI and IBM versions around by
 * having my make file replace estruct.h with one that has a IBMPC defined
 * only when I compile IBMPC.C and then switching back to estruct.h with
 * TIPC defined. Its last step is of course linking in the correct object
 * module for each exe.
 *
 * You can define any buffer to be reverse video by setting the
 * foreground to "BLACK" and the background to any other color
 * such as "cyan" to get Black on Cyan text.  There is no way to get
 * colors such as 'White on blue' on the TIPC unless it has a
 * least a 1-plane graphics card in it.  If it does have a graphics
 * card installed the code to change overall background
 * color is tied to the $palette variable with the same values as
 * TI BASIC and the Tech Reference manual section 3.5.2 as well as
 * being the #define for the color here without the enable attribute.
 * The text mode forground/background code still works even when you
 * use a $palette backgound giving you a wide range of what can be
 * done even though some combinations don't really work too well.
 *
 * The only reason that there are any '#if color' directives is because of
 * the need to maintain structure alignments.  This is because TI's mono
 * is really 8 shades instead of 8 colors and all attributes  remain the
 * same.  You can have color and mono attached at the same time and
 * display on both without any program support or hardware changes.  So
 * you should define color. It *will* make a difference in other areas of
 * the MicroEmacs code. You also do not have to do anything special for
 * the palette code because writing to a nonexistant graphics plane on a
 * TI causes *no* ill effects (at least according to the tech manual).
 *
 * Note that if you recieve MicroEmacs for the TIPC compiled by me
 * it is compiled/linked so that wildcard file names on the command
 * line are automagicly expanded in case you want to work with several
 * similarly named files.
 *
 * Changes to the other files to support the the TIPC MEMAPed
 * version compiled under Zortech C/C++ 1.02 to 2.10 follow.
 * BTW - The version I used is 2.18 but the earlier versions should
 * still be similar since I have compiled previous versions under whatever
 * was current at the time and even the previous ZTC version sometimes.
 *
 * [I simply added Ron's #ifdef changes to the master sources - Dan]
 *
 *     I once thought there were three ways to correct the problems with
 * DSR writes to the *25th* line, I now know some don't work.
 *     One was to check the start register before all screen writes. After
 * some investigation and testing I found that the  6545A Start of screen
 * registers are write only.  So there is not way to correct cursor
 * postioning and line position whenever DOS has changed the register.
 * Changing the start of screen pointer to offset 0 before screen writes
 * also didn't solve the problem completely.  As soon as you touched a key
 * after the error you ended up with the screen properly postioned, but
 * you had the error message on the screen until that line was updated so
 * you still ended up using a ^L to correct the screen.
 *     Two is to capture critical errors (mlwrite and errors are the sources
 * of DSR writes to the 25th line) and handle them myself (asm is
 * only clean way) and now looks like the only way it is possible but must
 * be used in conjuction with a modified method three too.
 *     Three was change writes to the message line to direct screen writes
 * and initialize the screen so that a critical error will write to the
 * text portion of the screen where any repaints would clear it.  The same
 * problems cropped up that did in number one where you needed to do a ^L
 * to totally clean up the screen if the error occured while on the message
 * line anyway so....
 *     Therefore a combination of two and three is most likely the best
 * way if it can be done since TI does not recommend mixing DSR and direct
 * writes to screen (if  I could read the 6545 registers 0Bh and 0Ch I
 * could manage it though).  This is because the DSR writes *can* change
 * the screen start register. The problem with a 2+3 solution is mainly
 * that the extra code to handle single character writes, directly
 * controlling the cursor though the CRTC cursor registers, and the
 * intercept/write/read error code handling bloats the code a bit and
 * coding in anything but assembly language (which  then needs to be
 * interfaced to each C compiler that might be in use) is the only reasonable
 * way.  I just came came to the conclusion that it wasn't worth it since
 * a ^L will clear things up anyway after the error is corrected.
 *
 * 12/29/89 -
 *   Changed lnptr, sline, and scptr to char/char*'s because TI writes
 *   only a character at a screen position and IBM a char + attribute.  TI's
 *   attributes are kept up by the hardware except when changed. So we only
 *   write a char at a time, not an int like the IBM code did.  This also
 *   corrected a minor bug with the message line eeol's which is why I
 *   looked at the driver code again.
 *
 * 12/30/89 -
 *   added the capability of setting the background on machines with
 *   graphics by setting the palette string with a number from 0 to 7.
 *   you do this with ^XA $palette  (note small letters) and a value.
 *   Values >= 8 will work since I do modulo division on the value
 *   but results are the same as the color values in TI BASIC.  The
 *   code, as always, works on all TI's but will not produce a change
 *   on non-graphics equiped TI's.  This code also does not need a color
 *   monitor to work since a TI doesn't know what kind of monitor is
 *   attached and may even have color and mono attached at once.
 *
 *   With the code set up so you can still do reverse video on any TI
 *   by defining BLACK and yellow (or any other background color) you
 *   have a large variety of posible screen setups.  So experiment.
 *
 * 12/31/89 to 1/7/90 - experimented with various methods of eliminating
 *   problems with mixed DSR/Direct_Memory writes.  Decided not to really
 *   attempt a solution at this time.  Write Ron Lepine if you have
 *   any feelings/suggestions on this problem, they are welcome.
 *
 * 1-9-90
 *   3.10.c(Beta) New IBMPC reverse video code added to TIPC driver.
 *
 *   Addional changes to 3.10.c(beta) to get it to compile with Zortech C/C++
 *     **** NOTE THESE CHANGES ARE NO LONGER NEEDED FOR ZTC 2.10 *****
 *      isearch line 172/5, 191 - change lines to
 *
 *            if (kfunc == &forwsearch || kfunc == &forwhunt ||
 *                kfunc == &backsearch || kfunc == &backhunt)
 *            {
 *                dir = (kfunc == &backsearch || kfunc == &backhunt)?
 *                REVERSE: FORWARD;
 *
 * 5-26-90
 *   Updated first part of this file to reflect 3.11beta line numbers
 *   while compiling 3.11 beta under Zortech C/C++ 2.1.
 *
 * 6-04-91
 *   Added last eight needed values to ctrans[] so standard emacs.rc file
 *   now works.
